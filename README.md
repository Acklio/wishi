# Work on IoT Semantic/Hypermedia Interoperability (WISHI)
This repository is used as a workspace to continue the work and discussions from the [WISHI workshop](https://github.com/t2trg/2017-07-wishi). 

The main workspace at the moment is the WISHI wiki: https://github.com/t2trg/wishi/wiki

## Meetings and calls

After the first workshop we have had multiple WISHI calls and face-to-face meetings. For information about the past and future meetings and calls see the Agenda wiki page: https://github.com/t2trg/wishi/wiki/Agenda-items
